## Description

Test project utilizing Mongo Graph.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm i -g yarn @nest/cli
$ yarn
```

## Notes before running the app

Set your constant config in the `src/configs/constants.ts` file. Please note the mongo URL string you enter here, should be the one you will enter must be the same as `<YOUR_MONGODB_URL_STRING>` in running the seeder.


## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ yarn start

# watch mode
$ yarn start:dev

# production mode
$ yarn start:prod

# initialize the DB with necessary data
$ node dist/store-seeder-script.js <YOUR_MONGODB_URL_STRING>
```



## Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ yarn test

# e2e tests
$ yarn test:e2e
```

>## Notice

- I added `status` field to soft-delete entities, so I don't remove them from DB.
- I aggregate user API with different type of `MANAGER` and `EMPLOYEE` in one API as I think it makes sense to do so because they are different in only `type` query filter.
- I could reference the child stores in `store` model but I preferred to save `parenetStore` as the project could grow, and it is not efficient to save letâ€™s say for example `50` entries as `childStore` for each `store.`
- I used `bcryptjs` for hashing `password`s for the sake of simplicity, but in production projects, we should use `bcrypt` as it uses `C` under the hood and is almost `100` times faster than `bcryptjs` which uses `JavaScript` for the same tasks.

- I used the `name` as `username` and `password` of the users in the `seeder script` for the sake of brevity.
- I used the DB properties as inputs and outputs for the sake of simplicity, but in the production project, I prefer `snake_case_keys` for request and response and `camelCase` for database schema.
- Right now the `refreshToken` field of the user model is useless, I would add another API to get the same `accessToken` as its response with `refreshToken` as its request to provide a better DX for clients.
- The `Authorization` mechanism which uses only one `Interceptor` is so fragile and is completely route-dependent and I could use `CASL` or `casbin` libraries in the production project, considering whether I had the time to implement it.


>## Future development

This project can be improved with the following developments:

- [ ]  Replace`bcryptjs` with `bcrypt`.
- [ ]  Refactor the project so inputs and outputs keys would not be the same as DB fields. For example, replace `_id` with `id` and remove `__v` field using `toJSON` mongoose built-in virtual.
- [ ]  Add an API that accepts `refresh_token` as its request body and returns the `OAuth2` standard response.
- [ ]  Overhaul the `Authorization` with `CASL` or `casbin` libraries.
